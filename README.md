# AlgorithmX--Sudoku
"Algorithm X is a recursive, nondeterministic, depth-first, backtracking algorithm that finds all solutions to the exact cover problem." wiki.
it has been introduced by Dr. Donald Knuth in his book, the art of computer programming.
reading the details about the algorithm motivated my to implement it myself using Java
my implementation is based on the c++ implementation from "	https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exact-cover-problem-algorithm-x-set-2-implementation-dlx/"
it's more efficient than normal backtracking algorithms,
i tested it with sudoku 64x64 and it worked perfectly, which
is impossible with a normal backtracing algorithm that has a complexcity of N^2
